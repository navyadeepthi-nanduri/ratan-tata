    <h1> <center> <strong> CAREER</strong></center></h1>
    <p1>Ratan Tata began his career in 1962 by joining the Tata Group, 
        starting at Tata Steel where he worked on the shop floor to gain hands-on experience in production and operations. 
        This practical grounding laid the foundation for his leadership journey. In 1991, he succeeded J.R.D. Tata as the Chairman of Tata Sons, becoming the head of the Tata Group, one of India’s largest and most respected business conglomerates.

Under his leadership, <strong><i>Ratan Tata transformed the Tata Group from a largely India-focused organization into a globally recognized brand. </i></strong>
He spearheaded several major international acquisitions, including Tetley Tea in the UK (by Tata Tea), Corus Group in the UK (by Tata Steel),
 and the iconic Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford (by Tata Motors). These bold moves significantly expanded Tata’s global footprint.

One of his most ambitious and people-centric projects was the launch of the Tata Nano in 2008 — known as the world’s 
cheapest car — aimed at providing affordable transportation to millions of Indian families. This innovation earned him global praise for addressing socio-economic challenges through engineering.

During his tenure, the revenue of the Tata Group grew more than 40 times and profit more than 50 times,
 making it a symbol of excellence in ethical business. He was instrumental in creating a unified and global identity for Tata companies,
  emphasizing innovation, quality, and values.

Ratan Tata was also deeply committed to philanthropy. Under his guidance,<mark> Tata Trusts significantly increased
 their support for education, healthcare, 
and rural development.</mark> He personally supported institutions like Harvard University, Cornell University, and the Indian Institutes of Technology.

In recognition of his contributions to industry and society, he received several prestigious honors, 
including the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008. Even after retiring as Chairman in 2012, 

he continued to serve as a mentor and returned briefly in 2016 to guide the group through a leadership transition.

Today, Ratan Tata remains an iconic figure in Indian and global business, known for his humility, vision, and unwavering integrity.</p1>
